TAS000001208752	Unable to archive the Batch record in COEBR R030334_02
User is unable to archive the Batch Record in COEBR due to Order independent inspection lots that are fetched and displayed in COEBR. Filtering logic is implemented to 
restrict the order indpendent inspection lots
TAS000001213963	print program issue
Performance issue in production when printing large quantity of clinical labels. When user clicks on print study labels the program triggers a back ground job 
to process the print request for the total quantity of the labels. During this process we need ABAP analysis on how the print request is getting created and processed. 
As per the logic is one custom parameter, which states that it creates one print request for one label. 

The ask here is to replace the custom parameter to standard one (EHS_SERLS0) and need to explore if one print request can be created for multiple labels and 
thus reduce the print timing.
